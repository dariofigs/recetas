                <p>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.</p>
                <p>In another bowl, add egg yolks, ricotta, milk, vinegar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Whisk until fully incorporated and you start to see some bubbles. Set aside.</p>
                <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together your egg whites just until stiff peaks form.</p>
                <p>Into the bowl with dry ingredients, add your wet ingredients and your fluffed egg whites. Completely mix together with a rubber spatula or whisk, making sure not to overwork the batter. Only mix until combined - no more dry flour. Your batter should look lumpy. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken more.</p>
                <p>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat for a few minutes, just until hot. Reduce the heat slightly before starting to cook the pancakes. When you add butter or oil to the pan, if it starts to brown, that means the pan is too hot and should let it cool.</p>
                <p>Once the pan is at the right heat, spray with oil or coat in butter and drop about 1/3 cup of batter. You could add more or less depending on what size you want them to be. Give it about 3 to 4 minutes on the first side. Bubbles should start to form on the top. That's when it's ready to flip. Let both sides turn slightly golden before taking off the pan. Continue this process until batter is out.</p>
